# Cull

We can paint FRONT, BACK or BOTH faces. MOst of the time you will only want to
display FRONT faces because BACK faces should be invisible. But in this demo, we
use the back faces to create an effect of outilining of a mesh.

This render has three passes:

1. Paint the background
2. Paint FRONT faces of the mesh
3. Paint BACK faces of an expanded (a little bit only) mesh
