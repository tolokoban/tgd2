# Parsing GLB files

It is common to edit 3D objects in specialized softwares like
[Blender](https://blender.org). And to get the most of it, the better is to
export your creating in a GLB file. This is the binary version of a
[GL Transfer Format](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.htm).

## Basic usage

Here is how you can load such file in TGD:

```ts
const asset = await tgdLoadGlb(url)
```

Or you can use an ArrayBuffer like this:

```ts
const resp = await fetch(url)
const data = await resp.arrayBuffer()
const asset = new TgdDataGlb(data)
```

For a quick render of a node, you can use
[TgdPainterMeshGltf](/docs/classes/TgdPainterMeshGltf.html).

```ts
const asset = await tgdLoadGlb(url)
const painter = new TgdPainterMeshGltf(context, {
    asset,
})
```

This painter will display the primitive #0 of the mesh #0 of the GLB file.

Now, if you have a more complex mesh with parents/children relationships and
maybe several primitives per mesh, then you can use this function:

```ts
const data = await tgdLoadGlb(url)
const node = tgdMakeMeshGlbPainter({ context, data })
```

## Advanced usage

### Creating a Dataset

```ts
const asset = await tgdLoadGlb(url)
const dataset = new TgdDataset({
    POSITION: "vec4",
    NORMAL: "vec3",
    TEXCOORD_0: "vec2",
})
asset.setAttrib(dataset, "POSITION")
asset.setAttrib(dataset, "NORMAL")
asset.setAttrib(dataset, "TEXCOORD_0")
const elements = asset.getMeshPrimitiveIndices()
const vao = new TgdVertexArray(context.gl, prg, [dataset], elements)
```

### Extracting a texture

```ts
const asset = await tgbLoadGlb(url)
const primitive = asset.getMeshPrimitive(meshIndex, primitiveIndex)
const material = asset.getMaterial(primitive.material)
const pbr = material.pbrMetallicRoughness
const texture = asset.createTexture2D(context, pbr.baseColorTexture?.index)
```

Just check if you the variables are all defined (we don't do this in the example
to not clutter the code).
