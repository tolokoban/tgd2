# Pascal triangle and fractals

The [pascal triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) has
many properties. One of them deals with fractals.

Look at this triangle below. We have set colors depending on the oddness of the
value (orange for odd, blue for even).

<PascalTriangle rows={11} modulo={2} />

You can see triangles appearing. But it would be better to have a view from far
and that's we will do in this example.
