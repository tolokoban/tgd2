# [TgdPainterLogic](docs/classes/TgdPainterLogic.html)

All the painters have both a `paint()` and a `update()` methods. When we call
`TgdContext.paint()`, the list of painters will be traversed twice: one time to
call the `paint()` function, and another time to call the `update()` one.

By convention, `paint()` will be the one to paint on the canvas, and `update()`
is just here to deal with the logic.

Most of the painters don't implement their `update()` method. But
`TgdPainterLogic` does. And moreover, it do not implement its `paint()` method.

## Example

In this example, we use `TgdPainterLogic` to change the color depending on the
time.
