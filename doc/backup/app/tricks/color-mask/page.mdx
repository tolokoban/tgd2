# Color Masking

<Demo />

As you can see in this demo, we can mask out any color channel. When we render
suzanne, we can just fill the depth buffer, but change none of the pixels.

As you will see in the next demo, this technique can be useful if you want to
have a rich (but fixed) environment in which you can move other meshes.
