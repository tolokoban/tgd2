# [TgdPainterFramebuffer](docs/classes/TgdPainterFramebuffer.html)

Every painter in this Group will be renderer in a texture and not directly into
the screen. You can then use this texture for whatever you want.

## Examples

1. [Reapinting on the same canvas](#/articles/painter/framebuffer/example1)
2. [Fractal effect](#/articles/painter/framebuffer/example2)
