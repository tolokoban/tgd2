Dynamic level of details.

## Example

Move the camera around to see how the mesh reacts.

<Demo />

In this demo, we just create a sphere that fills the bounding box of the current level of details.
The higher the level, the more high res the sphere is.

This is just a way for you to see how the octree splitting acts.

The [next demo](#/articles/painter/lod/detail) is a more useful usecase: we will display a complex mesh that looks more detailed when we are near.
