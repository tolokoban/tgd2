# Painters

A **Painter** is a class that paints the WebGL canvas. Yon can create your own
by ingeriting the abstract class `TgdPainter`, or use an existing one.

You can chain several painters in a `TgdPainterGroup`. Thaye will be called in
the order they are inserted.

`TgdContext` has an internal `TgdPainterGroup`. That's why, you can see in many
examples that we add painters directly to it.

-   [Clear](#/articles/painter/clear): fill all the pixels of the canvas with a
    unique color.
-   [Logic](#/articles/painter/logic): update the status of your scene at every
    frame.
-   [Background](#/articles/painter/background): fill the background with an
    image.
