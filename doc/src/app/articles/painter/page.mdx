# Painters

A **Painter** is a class that paints the WebGL canvas. Yon can
[create your own](#/articles/painter/custom) by inheriting the abstract class
`TgdPainter`, or use an existing one.

You can chain several painters in a `TgdPainterGroup`. They will be called in
the order they are inserted.

`TgdContext` has an internal `TgdPainterGroup`. That's why, you can see in many
examples that we add painters directly to it.

-   [Background](#/articles/painter/background): fill the background with an
    image.
-   [BackgroundWithDepth](#/articles/painter/background-with-depth): fill the
    background and the depth buffer.
-   [Clear](#/articles/painter/clear): fill all the pixels of the canvas with a
    unique color.
-   [Filter](#/articles/painter/filter): transform an image on pixel base.
-   [FragmentShader](#/articles/painter/fragment-shader):paint the whole screen with a Fragment Shader.
-   [Framebuffer](#/articles/painter/framebuffer):paint in a texture instead of
    directly to the screen.
-   [LOD](#/articles/painter/lod): paint a mesh with levels of details depending on the camera proximity.
-   [Logic](#/articles/painter/logic): update the status of your scene at every
    frame.
-   [Node](#/articles/painter/node): allow you to compose local transformations.
-   [PointsCloud](#/articles/painter/points-cloud): display a cloud of 3D points. 
-   [Segments](#/articles/painter/segments): lines with variable thickness.
-   [Sprites](#/articles/painter/sprites): fast paint of many atlas sprites.
-   [XRay](#/articles/painter/x-ray): X-Ray view.
