In case you have a fixed camera and a complex environment you can optimize the
painting by pre-rendering it in Blender and generating a low poly version of it.

TgdPainterBackgroundWithDepth will paint the high definition image and fill the
depth buffer with the low poly mesh. If the canvas size doesn't change, then the
low poly mesh won't even been rendered.
