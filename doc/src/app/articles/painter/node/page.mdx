# [TgdPainterNode](docs/classes/TgdPainterNode.html)

All objects implementing `TgdInterfaceTransformable` have a `transfo` attribute
that controls its position/orientation/scale in the world coordinate system. If
you need an object's transformation to be defined in another object coordinate
system, you just have to wrap it in a `TgdPainterNode`.
