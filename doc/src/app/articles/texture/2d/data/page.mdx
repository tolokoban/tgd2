# Texture2D from data

Sending data to a texture is more tricky than expected becaue you have to care
care of **memory alignement**.

Each row of your data must have a number of bytes that is an integral **multiple
of 4**.

In the following example, we are using only 3 bytes per pixel because we
specified RGB as format. Since we want a width of 5, we end up with **15 bytes**
in a row. We cannot divide 15 by 4, so we **MUST add a padding** value at the
end of the row to have 16 bytes.

If the width you want is 3, for example, then you will need a padding of 3
bytes.
