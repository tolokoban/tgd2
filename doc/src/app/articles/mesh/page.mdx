A mesh is made of a **geometry** and a **material**.

-   [Material](#/articles/mesh/material): using TgdMaterial with 3D meshes.
-   [Geometry](#/articles/mesh/geometry): using TgdGeometry with 3D meshes.

Special cases:

-   [Marching cubes](#/articles/mesh/marching-cubes): create triangles from a
    volume defined by Signed Distance Functions.
