# Play / Pause

To animate your game, you need to paint many still images. The best is to be
able to paint 60 images per second.

Everytime you want to paint a single frame, you can call `TgdContext.paint()`
method. But if you want to start ananimation that will try to paint 60 frames
per second, you can use `TgdContext.play()`. And `TgdContext.pause()` will stop
the animation.

Tap the screen in the demo below to start/stop the animation.
