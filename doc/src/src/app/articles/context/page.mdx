# TgdContext

[TgdContext](docs/classes/TgdContext.html) is the main class of TGD. It's a
wrapper around a Canvas that gives you access to the WebGL context
(`context.gl`) and some useful helpers.

```ts
const canvas = document.getElementById("my-canvas")
const context = new TgdContext(canvas, {
    depth: true,
    stencil: true,
    powerPreference: "high-performance",
})
```
