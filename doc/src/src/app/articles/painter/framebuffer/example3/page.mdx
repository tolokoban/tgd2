# [TgdPainterFramebuffer](docs/classes/TgdPainterFramebuffer.html) - Example 3

Let's use the framebuffer to simulate water. We want the objects deeply flooded
to be almost invisible. That's why we need to store the height of every rendered
pixels.

In this demo, we store the distance from the camera on the alpha channel. That
means, that w have only 1 byte for the resolution. You can see some weird lines
in the texture under the water.
