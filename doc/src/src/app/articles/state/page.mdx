# States

The class [`TgdPainterState`](/docs/classes/TgdPainterState.html) help you
manage four WebGL concepts. It's a **Group** painter. The context for the 4
concepts will be restored once all the children have been painted.

-   [Blend](#/articles/state/blend): how you mix the color of your painting with
    what is already on screen.
-   [Cull](#/articles/state/cull): prevent the painting of triangles facing
    front or back.
-   [Depth](#/articles/state/depth): precent fragments to be painted if farther
    (or nearer) that existing ones.
-   [Stencil](#/articles/state/stencil): all sort of masking operations.
